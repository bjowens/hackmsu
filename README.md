## What it does
Welcome to **Code Invaders**, where learning to code becomes an intergalactic adventure! In this engaging game, you pilot a spaceship armed with a laser, using it to blast away the correct answers to coding questions. With each level, the challenges grow in complexity, testing your coding knowledge and skills. 

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, **Code Invaders** makes learning fun and interactive. Join the battle against coding challenges and conquer the universe of programming knowledge, one laser blast at a time!

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for our app, **Code Invaders**, came from a desire to gamify coding education, aiming to make it accessible, engaging, and enjoyable. 

We envisioned an immersive and entertaining adventure where players can sharpen their coding skills while navigating through thought-provoking questions and advancing through various levels.

## How we built it
**Code Invaders** was built using the _Java_ programming language and _Greenfoot_, a beginner-friendly framework for creating educational games.

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenges came from implementing the _Greenfoot_ framework. This is due to the fact that _Greenfoot_ uses an event-driven programming model, where actions are triggered by events such as mouse clicks or key presses. Understanding how to structure code to respond to these events effectively can be tricky.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the game we built in 24hrs. Getting the rocket to navigate in different directions (left, right and up) as well as having the asteroids appear randomly on the screen were the "ah ha" moments that really got us excited.

## What we learned
For two of us, this was our first hackathon! We learned how "quickly" we could develop a working app in a collaborative setting. Many of us also worked with new technologies for the first time. Whether it was digging through documentation or teaming up to tackle stubborn problems, the MorganHacks hackathon reminded us of the importance of staying adaptable and learning on the fly.

## What's next for Code Invaders
Future updates to **Code Invaders** will introduce customizable challenges, allowing players to focus on specific coding languages and frameworks for targeted practice sessions.
